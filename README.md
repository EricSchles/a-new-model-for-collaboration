# a-new-model-for-collaboration

The idea here is simple:

Start with a problem, any problem.  Have all interested parties begin by looking at and internalizing the problem and then coming up with their own
thoughts and feelings about how to best solve or achieve the objective of the problem.  As well as what the objective should be.

Then some time is taken for all parties to write or create their solution.

Then solutions are synthesized - all solutions are brought together, read, understood and debated, on their merits.  And then next steps are taken.

This process can be broken down into chuncks:

for idea in ideas:
  Duplication of work for MVP
  Synthesis of MVPs into final MVP
  For region in task:
    Duplication of work for region
    synthesize work for each region
synthesize ideas

The process then goes as follows:

ideation -> MVP construction -> building out project -> completion

At each stage, new ideas can be added and bad ideas can be pruned, effectively killing any work associated with such an idea.  However if 
specific tactical pieces make sense to keep, they can be kept.

I call this idea, redudant collaboration.  Everyone does all the work at each stage, this way everyone has domain expertise of all the pieces.
This allows individuals to shine in their respective areas, as well as work to gain domain expertise in other areas of the work.  In this way,
everyone learns everything so redudancy is built into the build process.  This way, ideas and work are done together, but seperately.  But
the high level is collaborated on.  While execution is assumed to be effective for each member.

Proposed areas of doing this:

Managerial level teams
Full stack web developer teams
Data Science teams

Advantages:

Increased quality of work
Richer meetings and conversations
Strong team integration
Clear path for getting up to speed on work
Individuals become stronger, in all tasks, over time
Fewer cliques

Drawbacks:

Development time is slower
People work together less so you are more responsible for your own work product
Less opportunities for pair programming, for working together one on one.
